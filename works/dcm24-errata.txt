The typing rule for the "fill" constructor in Definition 12 incorrectly allows the variable i to appear in the constraint equations of the boundary Ï•.
A corrected rule can be found in Definition 2.12 of https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12169v2. The problem with the original definition is described in Remark 2.14 therein.
Since the paper was written with the correct rule in mind, nothing else is affected by making this correction.
